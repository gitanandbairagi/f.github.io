            <p class="contentText">
                After reprising his role as The Joker in Zack Snyder's Justice League, Jared Leto is returning to the world of comic books in a role that should offer him a bit more screen time. Sony's Morbius movie has finished filming and, after several delays, will drop at the start of the new year. Jared Leto plays Michael Morbius, a doctor who tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease but in the process imbues himself with vampire-like traits, including a lust for human blood. Morbius is directed by Daniel Espinosa and will also star Doctor Who alum Matt Smith as the villainous Loxias Crown. The rest of the cast is rounded out by Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Tyrese Gibson, and Michael Keaton, seemingly reprising Adrian Toomes (a.k.a. Vulture). Keaton's presence in the film suggests that Morbius, like Venom: Let There Be Carnage, is actually part of the MCU through a collaboration between Marvel Studios and Sony.

            <p class="contentText">
                Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Doctor Strange in Avengers: Infinity War earned him widespread acclaim, which is partly why Marvel Studios Phase 4 set up Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. With Sam Raimi signed on to direct from a script by Jade Bartlett and Loki's Michael Waldron, Doctor Strange's second solo adventure won't see him entirely alone. Wanda Maximoff, a.k.a. Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) will play a large role in the story, paying off some of the setups from WandaVision; however, the bulk of the narrative is still being kept under wraps. While Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was originally planned to be a horror movie, it seems unlikely that this is the case as Scott Derickson left the production when it became clear that he couldn't make it the horror that he wanted, and What If...? explored a horror take on Doctor Strange already in one of their episodes.

                Benedict Wong, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Rachel McAdams will return, like Wong, Baron Mordo, and                Christine Palmer, respectively. They'll be joined by MCU newcomer Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez.              The story will presumably be heavily influenced by the events of WandaVision, Loki, and Spider-Man:             No Way Home.

            <p class="contentText">
                With Thor: Love and Thunder, the Asgardian warrior becomes the first MCU hero to get a fourth solo movie. Thor: Ragnarok's Taika Waititi returns to write (alongside Jennifer Kaytin Robinson) and direct the proceedings. Love and Thunder will mark the return of Natalie Portman's Jane Foster to the MCU. Jane will become a female version of Thor, while new Asgardian king Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) will be on the hunt for her queen. With several other familiar faces set to flit in and out of the story, Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) will serve as the central source of conflict.

            <p class="contentText">
                Ryan Coogler's Black Panther quickly became one of the biggest Marvel movies of all time, and while its international gross wasn't on the same level as Avengers: Infinity War (which no one expected it would be), there's no denying that it was an astounding success - critically and commercially - for Marvel Studios. So, it's no wonder that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is set to happen, with Coogler back in the director's chair. After Chadwick Boseman's tragic passing, there are no plans to recast the role, and the production team has confirmed that they will not be using CGI to add Boseman's likeness to the movie. Instead, the sequel is set to focus on other aspects of Wakanda, its people, and its culture. As usual, story details are scarce this far out from its summer 2022 release. However, Namor the Sub-Mariner will reportedly join the MCU in the Black Panther sequel.

                In addition to developing the story, it took several years to create the animation style that's seen in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which was released in December 2018 and quickly became one of the most beloved superhero movies ever released. Shortly before Into the Spider-Verse hit theaters, Sony Pictures confirmed plans to produce a sequel. While story details are scarce, Into the Spider-Verse set up two sequels that allow for Miles Morales' story to branch off in multiple directions. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2 has officially webbed up a 2022 release date and will include the addition of Japanese Spider-Man.

                While not a hit quite as big as the likes of Avengers: Endgame, Captain Marvel's first adventure was still a massive success. As such, it's no surprise that Brie Larson's Carol Danvers is set to return for a sequel towards the end of 2022. As usual for Marvel, almost nothing is known about Captain Marvel 2's plot this far out from release. It will, however, take place in the modern-day. Equally, now officially retitled as The Marvels, the sequel will see Carol join forces with a now grown-up Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani). The latter will make her debut in the Ms. Marvel Disney+ series, and together they will square off with Zawe Ashton's mystery villain. Nia DaCosta has signed on to direct, with WandaVision's Megan McDonnell officially penning the script.

            <p class="contentText">
                Following in the footsteps of Venom and Morbius, the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters will continue with Kraven the Hunter. The idea for the solo movie was first broached in 2018. By 2020, it had a script written by Richard Wenk and then re-written by Art Marcum and Matt Holloway. Soon after, J.C. Chandor entered talks to direct the film - however, it's worth noting that little was heard about potential developments in the months that followed. Production took a huge leap forward in May 2021, however, when Aaron Taylor-Johnson landed Kraven's titular role. Set for an early 2023 release, the move sparked endless questions about the film's potential place in MCU's multiverse, given his previous turn as Pietro Maximoff (a.k.a. Quicksilver).

            <p class="contentText">
                Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 has already had a rocky road to production, with director James Gunn being fired by Disney after offensive jokes he made on Twitter years earlier resurfaced. After both fans and colleagues came out fiercely in support of Gunn, the decision was ultimately made to rehire him - though not before he'd already been snapped up by Warner Bros. to direct The Suicide Squad. Gunn moved swiftly from that to a Peacemaker TV spinoff centered on John Cena's Peacemaker. As a result, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 reportedly won't start filming until 2021's final months, at the earliest. Therefore, it'll be a while before we see the team back in action and any story details are revealed. However, the full cast is confirmed to be returning, following on from cameo appearances in Thor: Love and Thunder.

Despite being played by Emma Fuhrmann in Avengers: Endgame, the character of Cassie Lang will be assumed by Kathryn Newton. With an early 2023 release date confirmed, filming has already begun in England. Peyton Reed once again took on directorial duties, working from a script penned by Rick and Morty's Jeff Loveness. The shrinking superheroes will face their biggest challenge yet, with the iconic Marvel villain Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) making his MCU debut.

                Marvel has one unassigned MCU release date left in 2023 after their October 2021 schedule reshuffle. That date is November 3, 2023. There are several options for movies that might fill this slot when announced. The less likely options are Captain America 4, Deadpool 3, or even the planned mutant film. However, the two most likely candidates are Blade and the MCU's reboot of Fantastic Four.

                Blade has a script written by Stacy Osei-Kuffour, and the Oscar-winner Mahershala Ali is attached to play the vampiric-vampire-slaying titular hero. The MCU is dropping a lot of hints that Blade is not too far off after Easter eggs hinted at his existence in Loki, and he was then Mahershala Ali's Blade was confirmed to be the voice speaking to Kit Harrington's Dane Whitman/Black Knight in Eternals.
