        <p><i>The Multiverse is a concept about which we know frighteningly little.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As seen in the end credits of Spider-Man: No Way Home, Marvel Studios has officially debuted the teaser trailer and poster for the highly-anticipated Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness â€” a thrilling ride through the Multiverse with Doctor Strange, his trusted friend and Sorcerer Supreme Wong and Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness arrives only in theaters on May 6, 2022!
            <br><br>
            In the teaser, above, Doctor Strange doesn't heed Wong's warning, "Don't cast that spell.   It's  too  dangerous." Strange realizes they "tampered with the stability of spacetime."  Mordo's   voice  threatens, "Your desecration of reality will not go unpunished," as Strange     steps out  into what  appears to be the Mirror Dimension.
            <br><br>
            Strange pleads, "But I never meant for any of this happen," as viewers see glimpses of an       abandoned     Sanctum Sanctorum, mayhem in the streets, Christine Palmer's wedding to   someone     other than Strange,     Wanda Maximoff's glowing hands, and a battered Wong. 
            <br><br>
            Strange visits Wanda at her new home in a remote area. Wanda declares, "I made mistakes     and     people  were hurt," not realizing Strange is not there to discuss the events in     Westview, as    seen in Marvel  Studios' WandaVision. He needs her help regarding the   Multiverse.
            <br><br>
            Mordo reminds Strange, "The greatest threat to our universe is you," just as Strange comes  face     to  face, well, with his face, who smugly states, "Things just got out of hand."

            The Sam Raimi-directed sequel stars returning cast Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange), Benedict Wong (Wong), Rachel McAdams (Christine Palmer), and Chiwetel Ejiofor (Mordo), as well as the addition of Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda Maximoff) and newcomer Xochitl Gomez who will portray America Chavez, a new fan-favorite from the comics.
